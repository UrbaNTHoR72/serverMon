server monitoring software - php

This is a simple server monitoring php site.

It is being primarily built in php and is tied directly to what i need it to do.
This is my first web development project and as such I am not the best.

Files that will NOT be uploaded include the PDO connection as it contains login credentials and
the password_hash() compatibility library that I use because my webserver is not on php V5.5, this is because the library
is not my own and can be found here: https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat
